# EloSort

Given a list of related items that can be sorted from best to worst, this app makes it so that process is easily done. Instead of manually comparing every item, two random items in the list are compared. By choosing the better of the two, the approriate elo can be distributed. As you continue to pick the better of two random items, the list of items becomes sorted to your liking.
